# 🔐 Secure Video Stream Pipeline (Learning Project)

This is a learning-focused project where I build a **video streaming data pipeline** with support for:

- 📹 Real-time video capture
- 🔒 Encryption (ChaCha20)
- 📦 Compression (LZ4)
- 🌐 Optional [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tunneling for secure remote access

The goal is to understand how to build and modularize such a system for both **local** and **remote access**.
